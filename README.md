# Smart_SDLC
SmartSDLC uses the Granite model from Hugging Face to speed up software development. It lets users upload PDFs, generate clear requirements, turn prompts into code, create tests, fix bugs, write docs, and chat with an AI helper. This project will be deployed in Google Colab using Granite for easy setup and reliable performance.
